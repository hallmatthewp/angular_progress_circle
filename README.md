# Angular Lib Template

This is a very basic starter template for creating an angular library, such as a directive or service. It uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) for asset compilation (Coffeescript and Less) and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and [Karama](http://karma-runner.github.io/) for testing.

To use the template as your starting point, just do the following:

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `bower install`
4. `gulp` to watch and auto-compile files
5. `karma start` to watch and auto-run tests
6. Delete the sample directive and spec and replace with your own code.
